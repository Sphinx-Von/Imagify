## 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imagegify.git
cd imagegify

# 2. Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# 3. Install server dependencies
cd ../server
npm install

🔐 Environment Setup

Create a .env file inside the server/ folder:

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
STABILITY_API_KEY=your-stability-api-key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-secret

🧪 Run Locally

# Start backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Start frontend
cd ../client
npm run dev

Visit the app: http://localhost:5173
💡 How It Works

    User enters a prompt like: "A futuristic cyberpunk city at night"

    Frontend sends the prompt to the backend

    Backend uses Stability AI API to generate an image

    Generated image is optionally uploaded to Cloudinary

    User can view, download, or save the image

💾 Image Download Feature

    Each generated image includes a download button

    Clicking it triggers a download using the download attribute or Blob URL

    File is saved with a unique name based on timestamp or prompt

🌐 Deployment Tips

    Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

    Backend: Render / Railway / Fly.io

    MongoDB: Atlas cloud DB

    Cloudinary: Set to auto-expire unused assets if needed
